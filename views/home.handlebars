        <p>&emsp;Instructions: The game consists of a number of rounds. In each round, a player gets three rolls of the dice, 
            although they can choose to end their turn after one or two rolls. After the first roll the player 
            can save any dice they want and re-roll the other dice. This procedure is repeated after the second roll. 
            The player has complete choice as to which dice to roll. It is possible to re-roll both dice that were or were not rolled before(Wikipedia)</p><br>
        <p>&emsp;Click roll or press enter to roll all dice.</p>
